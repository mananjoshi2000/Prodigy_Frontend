## Collaborative text Editor

- For ***collaborative*** feature of text editing we have used the [YJS](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/blob/master/README.md) framework. Yjs is a [CRDT implementation](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/blob/master/README.md#Yjs-CRDT-Algorithm) that exposes its internal data structure as _shared types_. 
- YJS establishes a P2P connection in which users visiting the website can communicate with each other 
- It supports many existing **rich text editors**, **offline editing**, **version snapshots**, **undo/redo** and **shared cursors**. 

For the **Text editor** we have used `Quill	`
- [Quill](https://quilljs.com/) is a modern rich text editor built for compatibility and extensibility
- It has very useful built in function that makes it very easy to built a text editor
- For the cursor part  we have used `Quill Cursors` so that user sees a different name when collaborating. You can check [here](https://github.com/reedsy/quill-cursors)
